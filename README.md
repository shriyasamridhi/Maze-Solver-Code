# Maze-Solver-Code

This project uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve a maze by finding the shortest path from a start point to an end point. It evolves move sequences like ['R', 'D', 'U', 'L'] to discover a valid and optimal path. The logic is written in Python, and the optimization is powered by the DEAP library.
